I came back to coding because it is giving me new challenges constantly, because of this, it also gives me constant satisfaction. It is a hard nut to crack but this is the whole point of it. <br />

We do things not because they are easy but because they are hard. There is another reason I am coming back to this. In other jobs I will mantain things, but in coding I will CREATE things.<br />

In conclusion, I like challenges, constant development and satisfaction from my work. That is why I am coding.<br />
